These files comprise my unique completion of Codecademy's C++ "tic-tac-toe" project.  
After viewing others' submissions, I can tell mine was needlessly complicated, using a grid system not of three sets of three, but including those nine spaces within a larger board, the framework of which was comprised of four vectors of six.  
But what learning is made better by understanding your mistakes, so I'm happy with the overall product.  
Although at this stage of Codecademy's introductory C++ course, I had not learned about references, they were required to alter some global bools and vectors.
